## Abstract
Few-shot learning consists in addressing data-thrifty (inductive few-shot) or label-thrifty (transductive few-shot) problems. So far, the field has been mostly driven by applications in computer vision. In this work, we are interested in stressing the ability of recently introduced few-shot methods to solve problems dealing with neuroimaging data, a promising application field. To this end, we propose a benchmark dataset and compare multiple learning paradigms, including meta-learning, as well as various backbone networks. Our experiments show that few-shot methods are able to efficiently decode brain signals using few examples, and that graph-based backbones do not outperform simple structure-agnostic solutions, such as multi-layer perceptrons.

## Usage
### 1. Dependencies
- Python = 3.6 
- Pytorch = 1.3

### 2. Dataset construction
The original IBC data [1] are accessible on NeuroVault [2]. In the dataset folder, we propose a notebook to discover the data and a notebook to adapt the data to the few-shot learning setting. You have to execute them to download the data from NeuroVault and to split them in a random way in three parts (base dataset, validation dataset, novel dataset).

### 3. Few-shot learning paradigms
Our code is built upon the original codes of ["How to train your MAML"](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJGven05Y7) (MAML_plus_plus) and ["SimpleShot: Revisiting Nearest-Neighbor Classification for Few-Shot Learning"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.04623.pdf) (SimpleShot). They have been adapted to work on new backbone networks and on new data.

By using this code, you agree to the [license](https://github.com/mbonto/fewshot_neuroimaging_classification/blob/main/LICENSE) file of this work and to the license files of the original codes of MAML_plus_plus and SimpleShot.

#### SimpleShot [3]
Go to the SimpleShot folder. To train a backbone and evaluate the SimpleShot method on few-shot problems, have a look at the Train_and_evaluate notebook.
To evaluate a baseline based on a nearest class mean classifier, have a look at the baseline notebook.

#### PT + MAP [4]
Go to the SimpleShot folder. PT+MAP proposes a different way of solving few-shot problems based on the knowledge of other unlabeled samples (transductive setting). In this article, it relies on the backbone trained with SimpleShot. To evaluate PT+MAP method, have a look at the Train_and_evaluate notebook.

#### MAML++ [5]
Go to the MAML_plus_plus folder. To train a backbone and evaluate the MAML++ method, execute the following commands:

0- Dataset.\
To execute the MAML++ code, all images need to be stored in a folder in a particular way.
Thus, to prepare the data, go to the datasets folder and execute the notebook DownloadIBC.

1- Define the configuration of the experiment.\
Go to the experiment_config folder and execute the notebook Create config file.

2- Generate a script to launch the experiment.\
Go to script_generation_tools and execute the command: `python generate_scripts.py`.

3- Initialize the folder where results will be stored.\
Execute the notebook create_results_file.

4- Launch the training and the evaluation.\
Go to experiment_scripts and launch the scripts you have defined before. For instance,
`./IBC_5_way_1_shot_0_seed_GNN_model_1_depth_1024_features_few_shot.sh`. (You may need to authorize the execution of the script by executing the command
`chmod 777 IBC_5_way_1_shot_0_seed_GNN_model_1_depth_1024_features_few_shot.sh`.)

5- Results.\
Go to the results folder to see the results.

### 4. Backbone networks
We experiment three architectures of backbone networks: a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN).

- MLP: the input is seen as a simple vector describing the activity of the considered regions of interest. *We vary 2 hyperparameters: the number of hidden layers and the number of features per hidden layer.*

- GNN: the input is the vector described before. It is diffused once on a graph describing the interaction between regions of interest, and then it is handled by a MLP. Here are some precisions about the diffusion on  the graph:
    The graph we consider in this work is a thresholded structural graph (1% highest connection weights), previously introduced in [6]. The graph has been obtained with tractography, a method consisting in measuring the strength of the white fibers between regions in the brain.
    Denoting A the adjacency matrix of structural graph (such that A[i,j] represents the strength of the connections between region i and region j and A[i,i] = 0), we define the diffusion of an input vector on the structural graph as the matrix multiplication of the input vector with $\hat{D}^{-1}\hat{A}$, where $\hat{A} = A + max(A)I$ and $\hat{D}$ is the degree matrix of $\hat{A}$.
*We vary the same hyperparameters as a MLP.*

- CNN: 1x1 convolutional neural network, considering each region of interest independently up to the final layer of the architecture. The last layer is fully-connected. Before the last layer, the feature maps are averaged per input region. *We vary the number of hidden layers and the number of feature maps per hidden layer.*

### 5. Results
Here are the results obtained with two random splits (average accuracy and 95% confidence interval over 10,000 5-way tasks from the novel dataset).
